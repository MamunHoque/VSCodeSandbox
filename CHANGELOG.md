## [1.0.0] - Original Version

### Features (Original Script)
- Basic VS Code profile isolation
- Single profile support
- Manual directory setup
- Desktop integration
- Augment extension installation

### Issues (Original Script)
- **Destructive operations** - wiped existing VS Code settings globally
- **Single profile limitation** - only one profile could handle URIs
- **No error handling** - failed silently on many systems
- **Hardcoded paths** - only worked with snap VS Code
- **No backup/restore** - no way to recover profiles
- **System interference** - modified global settings

## Migration Guide

### From v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

#### Breaking Changes
- Script names have changed
- Command syntax has been updated
- Profile directory structure is different

#### Migration Steps
1. **Backup existing profiles** (if any) from the old script
2. **Remove old script** to avoid conflicts
3. **Install new version** using `install.sh`
4. **Recreate profiles** using new scripts
5. **Import projects** from old profile directories

#### New Commands
```bash
# Old way (v1.0.0)
./vscode-isolate.sh myproject

# New way (v2.0.0)
./vscode-isolate.sh myproject create
./vscode-working-launcher.sh myproject  # Recommended
```
