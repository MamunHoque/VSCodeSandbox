echo "â€¢ Each profile is completely isolated - no shared settings or extensions"
echo "â€¢ Profiles don't interfere with your existing VS Code installation"
echo "â€¢ You can have unlimited profiles for different projects or clients"
echo "â€¢ Use descriptive names for profiles (e.g., 'client-alpha', 'python-ml', 'react-frontend')"
echo "â€¢ Profiles include their own project directories, settings, and extensions"
echo

echo -e "${BLUE}ðŸ”— Next Steps:${NC}"
echo "1. Try creating your first profile: ./vscode-isolate.sh test-profile create"
echo "2. Explore the profile manager: ./vscode-profile-manager.sh launch"
echo "3. Run the test suite: ./vscode-isolation-test.sh"
echo "4. Check out development-setup.sh for advanced examples"
